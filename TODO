Things to do
-----------------------------------------

# Kiwi in general
- the unit tests are a big mess...
- an extension mecanism (using boost::extension)
- documentation
- tutorials
- try to build on windows and mac
- specify a serialization interface for containers (to text and to binary)

# kiwi::core
- formalize a way to make requests of readers and writers on a region with a locking mecanism

# kiwi::generic
- resize canvas method for ArrayContainer and MultiArrayContainer
- handle ways to access fragments that are out of the buffer (wrapping)
- tree based container (morton hash tree)
- gaussian blur filter

# kiwi::text
- TextContainer + Reader & Writer have been coded rapidly in a "proof of concept" fashion. it needs a better interface and a cleaner implementation 
- String container needs update 

# kiwi::image
- loading a .png file into a cairo container

# kiwi standalone application
- generate containers for the command-line input aguments (currently it only works with text)
- generate containers for the command-line output aguments
- specify the clent-server commands 

# Qiwi (Qt front end)
- well, everything !
